        <p>Winter here already but somehow I’m heatin‘ up, I got people talkin’ down man like I give a fuck, Yeah, I told 1da send me something and I got it covered, Are you down for the cause? Treating diamonds of Atlanta like it’s king of diamonds, I’m at or who I saw or, I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees, They will not tear nothing down I built this home for you momma,</p>
        <p>She worry bout me from home you know she raised me alone, I put it on ’erything it’s a err ting, No looking back when I’m gone, I just been out and bad from way back when, And assistants always convinced that there’s always someone better, Are you down for the cause? I gotta go out and get want you know what I did, Like 24/7 that’s where my life took me, I got one girl and she my girl and nobody else can hit it,</p>
        <p>This shit is everything to me this shit is everything, Hate that I treated like it’s a whatever thing, I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been, I got strippers in my life but they virgins to me, I got high hopes for you niggas we gon’ see, She worry bout me from home you know she raised me alone, Load up off a gate way, Top boy in this shit I’m so international, I’d rather give that 15% to people I fuck with,</p>
        <p>I can’t change this shit set in stone, I used to rap on the phone one of his friends doing life, Are we still good? Are we still good? Them niggas wannabes momma, 6 God selfish with the love I need all the praise, Cocaine Coupe we ain’t even gotta scale, Big as Madonna I’ll say it again, I’m almost at four minutes going off on the beat, Fuckin‘ with my image, I’m too good with these words, Man oh you gotta love it, I need some company, Ain’t no tellin’, Ain’t no tellin’ yeah ain’t no tellin’, Twice just let me go let me bring it home to you, Retired teacher but your words still got me evolving, He never let me do drugs, I got enemies got a lotta enemies,</p>
